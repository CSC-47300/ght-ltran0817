	<p>Yes, there is a project in Software Development class. <br>
		Our task is was to create an ecommerce website like Amazon. <br>
		Our group picked Django as our framework because most of us familiar with python or have some experience with
		it. <br>
		That was also my first time working in web developemnt and of other members too. <br>
		We couldn't finish the project because none of us knew Web development at the time. <br>
		The project still can be found at:
